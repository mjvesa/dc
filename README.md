DC is an experimental designer where the architecture is split in two:
Editor Core takes care of manipulating rectangles that are
used to draw trees by nesting them and placing them in various
arrangements. Designer Components handle the contents of those
rectangles.

Anyone is welcomed to take part in improving the Core Editor and to submit
new Designer Components.

Read the documentation about the DC API and look at the existing Components
for guidance.
